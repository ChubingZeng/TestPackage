Title: Regularized Regression with Differential Penalties Integrating External Information
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Chubing Zeng
Maintainer: Chubing Zeng <chubingz@usc.edu>
Description: This package has two usages. First, if external information Z 
  about the predictors X is provided, ipreg extends the standard Lasso and 
  Ridge regression to allow individual amount of shrinkage for each regression coefficient based on Z. The individual penalties are estimated by optimizing their marginal likelihood 
  with the majorization-minimization procedure. Second, if no external information Z is provided, ipreg provides
  an Empirical Bayes way to choose the tuning parameter in Lasso and Ridge regression, as an alternative to cross-validation.
