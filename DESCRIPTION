Title: L1 and L2 Penalized Regression with individual Penalties by Incorporating External Information
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Chubing Zeng
Maintainer: Chubing Zeng <chubingz@usc.edu>
Description: This package has two main functions. First, eb_tuning() provides an Empirical Bayes way 
     to choose the tuning parameter in Lasso and Ridge regression, as an alternative to cross-validation. 
     Second, ipreg() extends the standard Lasso and Ridge regression to allow individual amount of shrinkage 
     for each regression coefficient. The individual penalty parameters are modeled as a function of the external 
     information Z, and are estimated by optimizing their marginal likelihood with the majorization-minimization procedure.
